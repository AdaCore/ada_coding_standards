This section contains terms and values used in the definitions of the rules set forth in this chapter.

-------
Level
-------

**Level** is the compliance level for the rule. Possible values are:

   Mandatory
      A non-compliance with a rule of the *Mandatory* recommendation
      level corresponds to a high risk of software bug.
      As long as this non-conformity does not fall within the
      exceptional cases stated here, its consideration is mandatory and
      must systematically be the subject of a "technical fact".

   Required
      Non-compliance with a *Required* recommendation level rule does
      not lead to systematically risk of bug on the software but is
      considered as a risk significant deterioration in the level of
      satisfaction of a quality characteristic, from the point of view
      of the expected rules.
      One or a set of *Required* level non-conformities may be the
      subject of a "fact technical", since the benefit of remedying the
      non-conformity or all the non-conformities considered contributes
      significantly to improving the quality of the code.

   Advisory
      Failure to follow an *Advisory* recommendation level rule does not
      result in a software bug.
      Most often this is a recommendation that in general contributes
      effectively to the quality of the code.
      Depending on their number of occurrences, we will choose whether
      or not to remedy them.
      It is not considered to issue a "technical fact"
